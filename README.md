HW #1: Interpreter for a tiny toy language (PMPV)
9/19/2025

Manifest:
 - README.md: This file: overview and instructions
 - main.py: main Python script implementing the interpreter

 Requirements:
 - Python 3

 Running:

 'python3 main.py' will start the interpreter, waiting for an expression. As per requirements for the homework, there is no prompting or additional information provided. For example: 
    input: 3+4 
    output: 7
    input: x = 3+4
    output: //blank// but will store the result of x in a variable dictionary
    input: x
    output: 7

Bugs and Limitations:

-Tested and works as wanted as far as I am aware. 

-At the moment, just parentheses will not do multiplication 

Resources used:

-Course lectures
-Programming textbook(find real name)!!!!!!!!!
-w3schools.com as a reference guide for various syntax things
-Python documentation
